Based on the **Exar Super Fuzz SF-02** traced by **VitaliiBobrov** at www.freestompboxes.org

SF-2 is a fuzz pedal, handmade in Poland in 90s by not existing now Exar Electronix.

This version is modified a bit to my taste to improve clarity, tone and noise levels.

Project was assembled and tested - only thing that I messed up is a dual FREQ pot pins -> they are mirrored for one half of pot but it can be fixed by correct wiring so check the schematic first.

Please use Pieczarka logo on front side if you want to design own graphics or 'Pieczarka' or 'PCZR' for short.
